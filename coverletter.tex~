%\cvparagraph{This job sounds awesome}

As a fan of Jumping Rivers, I was excited to see your data science position advertised. With my varied data science experience, passion for learning and love of R, I believe I can support Jumping Rivers in developing and delivering your existing courses, and providing high-quality consultancy. I admire your ethos of giving back to the community, through meet-ups and supporting conferences as it is something that I value too.

\cvparagraph{How I can help Jumping Rivers}

As a data scientist I have worked closely with varied domain experts to implement statistical techniques. At Unilever I helped physicists classify accelerometer signals using linear discriminant analysis. During my time there I introduced them to using RMarkdown as a virtual labotory notebook, a practice which they have since adopted within the team. At Arctic Shores I worked with psychologists and game developers to create and validate psychometric models for game-based assesments. At Digital Rail I have gained experience in consultancy, creating visualisation tools to help engineers understand the maintainance of their fleet. In my role as an RSS Statistical Ambassador, I received have media training, helped journalists communicate facts and been a statistical consultant for the Panorama documentary “Plane Drunk”. I find that I learn best through teaching, something which I developed as my years as a tutor at Lancaster University, specialising in R.

\cvparagraph{Why I want to work for Jumping Rivers}
I would love to work for Jumping Rivers as the combination of delivering training courses and providing statistical consultancy is an truely exciting role for me. I believe this role will challenge me to keep learning and actively develop my skills. As well as statistical knowledge, I can bring enthusiasm, a passion for learning and appetite for challenge to Jumping Rivers.
