%\cvparagraph{This job sounds awesome}

I was very excited to see your data scientist position advertised. With my broad data science experience, passion for learning and love of R, I believe I can support Jumping Rivers in developing and delivering your existing courses, and providing high-quality consultancy. I admire your ethos of giving back to the community, through meet-ups and supporting conferences as it is something that I value too.

\cvparagraph{How I can help Jumping Rivers}
As a data scientist, I have worked closely with varied domain experts including physicists, psychologists, game designers and engineers. Successful projects include classifying accelerometer data and validating psychometric models for game-based assessment. I introduced my Unilever team to RMarkdown as a laboratory notebook, a practice which they have since adopted within the team, and at Arctic Shores I encouraged and supported the psychologists to develop a reproducible workflow in R. At Digital Rail I have gained experience in consultancy, creating visualisation tools in Shiny to help engineers explore the health of their fleet. I'm a confident communicator, and in my role as an RSS Statistical Ambassador, I have received media training, helped journalists communicate facts and providing consultancy for a Panorama documentary. I learn best through teaching, and have varied experience including formal University tuition, supporting R courses for industry and delivering public outreach talks.

\cvparagraph{Why I want to work for Jumping Rivers}
I would love to work for Jumping Rivers as the combination of delivering training courses and providing statistical consultancy is a truly exciting role for me. The best thing for me about being a statistician is being able to help people understand their data and this seems to be at the core of Jumping Rivers. I believe the role will challenge me to keep learning and actively develop my skills. As well as statistical knowledge, I can bring enthusiasm, a passion for learning and appetite for challenge to the Jumping Rivers team.
